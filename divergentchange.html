                Divergent change code smell refers to a tupe of change in which a single class or modile needed to be
                frequently modified, for multiple unrelated reasons, in other words, the calass or module is not having
                a single well defined purpose, other symptoms might also be that modification is required to change a
                part of the class
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                Copypasta programming style, not paying attention to what the current class actually poses inside of a
                program
            </p>
        </div>

                        As seen on the example above, this is one of the examples of divergent change, a single report
                        class can be seen doing a lot of function that will actually combine into one single function,
                        where the methods inside of the class will not be used inside any other part of the code, making
                        change almost impossible because every function is connected one to another, changing one means
                        changing all of them
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description-field">
                <div class="image-field">
                    <img src="Assets/divergentchange2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        For the solution, using extract superclass should be the right solution, making the report class
                        a single class that does a report on everything needed by the user <b>(Extract Superclass)</b>
                        other methods may include <b>Extract Class or Extract Subclass</b>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

            <p>
                Classes, functions and variables are now no longer coupled tightly making the code organization much
                more humane, then it also reduces the duplication caused by using other class or methods in different
                classes, lastly it simplifies on how the code can be modified
