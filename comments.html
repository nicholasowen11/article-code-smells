            <p>
                A method filled with explanatory contents, explaining each of the code's action in great detail,
                creating a cloud of confusion from the reader's perspective because not only they need to read the code,
                but also the documentation for the specific method, other symptoms would be to explain unnecessarily
                important nor logic draining line of code and making a comment out of that

            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                Comments are created with best intentions from the code writer, either as agood documentation or the
                writer realizes on how is the code is really ineffective, making it hard to understand without comments
                from the writer, it is also possible that the comments were not meant for the next developer to read but
                as a reminder for the writer themselves about how the code work because of how complex their own code is

                    <p>
                        As seen from the code above, it is filled to the brim with unnecessary code, even though it is
                        neither hard nor complex to understand, making the code crowded and not so easy to see
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description-field">
                <div class="image-field">
                    <img src="Assets/comments2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        what we can do is simply deleting the unnecessary comments crowding the code above, other than
                        that one can also do some treatment inside the method such as <b>Extract Variable</b> to make
                        the
                        variable much more clearer as its own class, <b>Extract method</b> to make it easier to identify
                        which method is what, <b>Remane Method</b> just to make it identifiable, and <b>Introduct
                            Assertion</b> which rules
                        about a state necessary for the system to work
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <div class="content-field-title">Payoff</div>
            <p>
                Removal of the comments will be making the code much more cleaner, and also making the code much more
                easier to understand because the problem itself is notn in the comments but why the comments are needed
                in the first place. Even though how to solve the problemn will differ from time to time, the end goal is
                to make the code more managable and easier to understand without comments needed
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <div class="content-field-title">When to ignore</div>
            <p>
                Commenting can sometimes be useful, sometimes when the code has to be implemented in a specific way then
                the commments would be needed, also when explaining an actual complex algorithms and every other
                methodds of shortening the algorithm has come short, then the developer can ignore this code smell
