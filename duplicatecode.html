            <p>
                Duplicate code is when there are two fragments of the identical or same code that does almost exactly
                the same thing, making it memory inefficient and crowding the whole coding space with unnecessary code,
                which will also slow the inner workings of the code.

            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                The causes will be that multiple programmers are working on the same project on different parts of the
                same program at the same time, since they are working on the same task, they sometimes will require to
                make the code, not realizing that the code they need has been made by the other person which is also
                working on the code, sometimes duplication is purposeful, when rushing to meet deadline and the existing
                code is "almost right" for the job, novice programmer may not be able to resist the temptation to just
                simply copy and paste the required work

                        From the code above it can be seen that the Order class will take care both the discounted and
                        non-discounted items, but it is separated inside of two different methods, which essentially is
                        also the same method with different outputs, making the code crowded for no apparent reason
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description-field">

                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        To solve the problem we can simply make the order as a class with only one method, but the
                        method will be handling both discounted and non-discounted items, this will not only clear the
                        code, but also making it easier to maintain <b>(Extract Method followed by Pull Up Field)</b>
                        other methods would be to do the <b>Pull Up Constructor Body</b> more
                        methods that can be used includes <b>Form Template Method</b> and other one will be to
                        <b>Substitute Algorithm</b>

            <p>
                Merging duplicate code simplifies the structure of the code and makes it shorter, it make sense when you
                think about it that when someone is making a method with almost the same function, insetad of using 2
                methods, one can simply combine both methods into the same method and call it a day, the code then will
                also be much more easier to understand and cheaper to support

            <div class="content-field-title">When to Ignore</div>
            <p>
                In very rare cases, merging two identical fragments can make the code less intuitive and obvious, some
                parts are meant to be split up i guess
