            <p>
                Speculative Generality is similar to the dead code smell but instead of the code being unused because it
                is no longer relevant, the opposite happens, it it a piece of code that is made to accomodate for the
                future but that future is not on the current development time, making the code much more complicated and
                unnecessarily hard to support and understand

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                Sometimes a code is created "just in case" to support eh features that is either never get implemented
                or is just planned and not being executed.

                        As seen from the code above, the developer gets the book ready for the update that he is
                        expecting to come, even though it has not been confirmed yet, he expects the book borrowing
                        system will have more features such as dates and the customer, but the developer implements it
                        immediately without waiting for confirmation which could make the program complicated, there are
                        two cases that might happen here, the first one the feature will be implemented and the code
                        will not be a smell, but the other one is the code being a smell and making the entire process
                        of making or manipulating this current classs difficult.

                        The solution to the problem above is to remove the complexity and return to the default book
                        borrowing form by using the boolean to check if a book is currently being borrowed <b>(Inline
                            Class)</b> or other methods could involve the <b>Inline Method, Remove Paramenter, or Remove
                            Fields</b> in which all will simplify on how the code will be implemented
                    </p>

            <div class="content-field-title">Payoff</div>
            <p>
                With the unused code removed, the code size will also be reduced and is also easier to support and
                control simply because the developer won't need to worry about that piece of code that won't be used
                either ways

            <p>
                If one is working in with a framework, it is reasonable to create functionality that won't be used
                inside the framework itself, the functionality may be needed by the user, so don't delete it, also
                before deleting the codes, make sure that is is not in the unit test, this happends if tests need a way
                to get certain internal information from a class or perform special testing-related actions
