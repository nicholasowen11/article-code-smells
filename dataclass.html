                Data classes are classes that only stores data and crude methods such as setters and getters for the
                data. Which in simple terms are containers used by other class to store their data within a space. These
                classes do not contain any additional functionality and cannot independently operate on the data that
                they own nor can they process them.

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                It is a normal thing when a newly created class contains only a few public fields and a handful of
                getters and setters, but when it stays like this for a very long time and is not getting modified, it
                will sooner or later cause a problem
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Example and Treatment</p>
            <div class="description-field">
                <div class="image-field">
                    <img src="Assets/dataclass1.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        As seen from the class, the class only stores data, sometimes it could also be good and did not
                        need refactoring such as in this case, it could actually be treated like a variable with a lot
                        of available values, but in the case where it is not good to do this, there are several ways to
                        refactor it such as <b>Encapsulate Collection</b> so that the getter returns a read only value
                        and create method for adding and removing item and <b>Move or Extract Method</b> so that the
                        method can be used multiple times
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <div class="content-field-title">Payoff</div>
            <p>
                By fixing these types of classes it will improve the undersyanding and organization of code, not only
                because they are inside a single class but also because all variables are gathered inside a single
                place, rather than getting split up inside a lot of subclass and is also easier to spot the happening
                dupllication and also making maintanance a lot simpler
