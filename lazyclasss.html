            <p>
                A lazy class is as the name suggests is a class that does not did enough to be considered a working
                class, especially when considering which class to keep, because keeping class will also require cost,
                time and money, so if a class does not need one's attention simply delete them or collapse them
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                A class could be made before it is broken into multiple classes because of refactoring that has been
                done into the class, then what is left is a small fragment of the class unworthy to be called a class,
                which is either too small, too unfunctional or many other reasons, or maybe that this class could be a
                class that has been planned on future development that no one has even had time to get done.

                    <p>
                        The class above is a lazy class where it only serves to insert a value and it is not worth to be
                        kept, not only it is wasting memory but is also making the code complex with no apparent
                        reasoning
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-field">

                    <p>
                        To treat this class in particular one could use the <b>Collapse Class</b> to make the class into
                        another class without creating another class, it is proven effective where the User class takes
                        care of it's own address instead of using another class as a middleman another method which can
                        be used for subclasses with few functions is the <b>Collapse Hierarchy</b>
                    </p>

            <div class="content-field-title">Payoff</div>
            <p>
                Reducing the code size because when combinging two class, it will reduce the code complexity bus still
                maintaining it's function, and it will be much more easier to maintain
            </p>

            <div class="content-field-title">When to Ignore</div>
            <p>
                Sometimes this type of class is created in order to delineate intentions for future development, even
                though it could be counted sa speculative generality, it is better for the code to not get refactored,
                since it will be used in the future, in which will maintain both balance and simplicity
