                A dead code is as the name suggests a code that has no function inside of the actual program, it is
                either no longer used, never actually meant to be used or used as a test class, either ways it is now
                obselete and is literally just existing

            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                When the requirement for the software have changed or corrections have been made, nobody has had the
                time to clean up the code and check the relationship between each line of code and if the code inspected
                is actually used inside of the program or not

                        From the code above if we can see that the code is not used inside of any part of the program,
                        the code is essentially useless and the solution is to delete it <b>(Delete Code)</b> there are
                        several wawys of knowing a dead code, one is by using a good IDE to know which part of the code
                        is yet to be used, in case of an unnecessaru class, <b>Inline Class</b> or <b>Collapse
                            Hierarchy</b> can be applied if a subclass or a superclass is used, and to remove unneeded
                        parameters simply use the <b>Remove Parameter</b>
                    </p>

            <p>
                With the unused code removed, the code size will also be reduced and is also easier to support and
                control simply because the developer won't need to worry about that piece of code that won't be used
                either ways
