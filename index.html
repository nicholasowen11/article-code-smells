    <h2>What are Code Smells?</h2>
    <p>
        Code smells are warning signs in your code that indicate potential problems. They might not cause immediate
        errors, but they can make your code harder to understand, maintain, and modify in the future. Imagine a kitchen
        with a faint burning smell - it might not be a full-blown fire yet, but it suggests something needs attention.
        There are a lot of code smells and these smells act like signposts, pointing towards areas where your code could
        benefit from refactoring. By identifying and addressing code smells, you can keep your codebase clean,
        well-organized, and easier to work with for yourself and your fellow developers.

    <h2>Why do we need to refactor the code?</h2>
    <p>
        Refactoring your code isn't just about making things look pretty; it's about investing in the long-term health
        and maintainability of your software. Here's why refactoring can be crucial:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Improved Readability:</b>
            <br>Clean, well-refactored code is like a well-written story - easier to understand for
            both you and other developers. This reduces time spent deciphering complex logic and allows for faster
            onboarding of new team members or revisiting your own code after some time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reduced Maintenance Costs:</b>
            <br>Code smells like duplication and long methods lead to a tangled mess
            that's difficult to modify. Refactoring simplifies the structure and makes changes less error-prone. Imagine
            trying to fix a circuit board with messy wires - refactoring is like organizing those wires for easier
            troubleshooting and future modifications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Enhanced Flexibility:</b>
            <br>Refactored code is often more modular and reusable. This means components
            can be more easily adapted for new functionalities or integrated into different parts of your
            application.Think of building blocks - refactoring allows you to create versatile blocks that can be used in
            various combinations for future needs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reduced Bugs:</b>
            <br>Complex code with tight coupling is a breeding ground for errors. Refactoring promotes cleaner
            separation of concerns and clearer data flow, making it easier to isolate and fix bugs. It's like
            preventative maintenance for your code, minimizing potential issues before they arise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Increased Developer Productivity:</b>
            <br>Developers working with clean, well-structured code spend less time wrestling with complexity and more
            time focusing on adding new features or fixing critical issues. Refactoring empowers your team to work more
            efficiently and deliver value faster.
        </li>
    </ul>

            The Change Preventers
            <p>
                These smells mean that if you need to change something in
                <br>one place in your code, you have to make many changes in
                <br>other places too. Program development becomes much more
                <br>complicated and expensive as a result.

            The Dispensables
            <p>A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose
                <br>absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and
                <br>easier to understand.
