                A small change needs to made inside multiple places within the codebase when making modifications
                inreasing the risk of missing some occurences and changes needed, and will also increase the chances of
                bugs
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Reason for the Problem</p>
            <p>
                A single responsibility has been split up among a large number of classes, making modifications long and
                painful for the ones to make them come to life
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-field">
            <p class="content-field-title">Example and Treatment</p>
            <div class="description-field">
                <div class="image-field">
                    <img src="Assets/shotgunsurgery1.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        from the example above, can be seen that the order class is quite seperated and to make changes
                        will require a lot of brute force, and is also less readable than a right, well written code
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description-field">
                <div class="image-field">
                    <img src="Assets/shotgunsurgery2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="writings-field">
                    <p>
                        so instead of mixing all of the logics and the decisions inside of the order class, we can move
                        the logic methods into another class (discountStrategy) to make the decisions for us, making the
                        order class as a middleman <b>(Move method)</b> other solutions might include <b>Move Field</b>
                    </p>

            <p>
                With less redundant code, the code will be much more organized, with less duplication and redundant
                code, and is easier to maintain due to the nature of the code.
